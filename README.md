#Code

##My raspberry pi developpement folder

###Arduino
My Arduino programms made to enhance raspberry functions (pwm, analog input,...) and to communicate with it

###Python
Most if my programms because that's the language I'm learning for now
I'va made a RCCar (gonna put the ios app to control it soon), a robot which turns when it hits an obstacle
I've also played with capacitive sensors...
And made a server that allows me to switch my light on and off from my iPhone (TCP protocol) (also gonna open source the ios code soon)
